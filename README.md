# Redub

Better file moving and renaming in Vim.

This deals nicely with updating any buffers open on files being moved.

See the help for more info.


## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git@github.com:notahat/vim-redub.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help redub`.


## Status [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/notahat/vim-redub.png)](https://travis-ci.org/notahat/vim-redub)

In active use on Vim 7.4. I'm sure there are loads of entertaining edge cases,
but it works well for day-to-day use.
